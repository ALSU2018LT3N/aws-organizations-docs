# AWS Config and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-config"></a>

Multi\-account, multi\-region data aggregation in AWS Config enables you to aggregate AWS Config data from multiple accounts and regions into a single account\. Multi\-account, multi\-region data aggregation is useful for central IT administrators to monitor compliance for multiple AWS accounts in the enterprise\. An aggregator is a new resource type in AWS Config that collects AWS Config data from multiple source accounts and regions\. Create an aggregator in the region where you want to see the aggregated AWS Config data\. While creating an aggregator, you can choose to add either individual account IDs or your organization\. For more information about AWS Config, see the [AWS Config Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/)\.
