# Creating and Managing an AWS Organization<a name="orgs_manage_org"></a>

You can perform the following tasks using the AWS Organizations console:
+ **[Create an organization](orgs_manage_create.md)**\. Create your organization with your current account as its master account\. Create member accounts within your organization, and invite other accounts to join your organization\.
+ **[Enable all features in your organization](orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.md)**\. You must enable all features to use the advanced features available in AWS Organizations, such as policies that enable you to apply fine\-grained control over which services and actions that member accounts can access\.
**Note**  
You can also choose to create your organization with only consolidated billing features enabled\. 
+ **[View details about your organization](orgs_manage_org_details.md)**\. View details about your organization and its roots, organizational units \(OUs\), and accounts\.
+ **[Delete an organization](orgs_manage_org_delete.md)**\. Delete an organization when you no longer need it\.

**Note**  
The procedures in this section specify the minimum permissions needed to perform the tasks\. These typically apply to the API or access to the command line tool\.  
Performing a task in the console might require additional permissions\. For example, you could grant read\-only permissions to all users in your organization, and then grant other permissions that allow select users to perform specific tasks\.
