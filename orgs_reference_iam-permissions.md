# Permissions You Can Use in an IAM Policy for AWS Organizations<a name="orgs_reference_iam-permissions"></a>

The following table shows the permissions that you can specify in an IAM permissions policy to grant access to an organization\. Each permission on an "Action" can be associated with a "Resource" that specifies what the action can work on\. 

All actions can use "Resource" : "\*", but you also can specify ARNs of the types that are shown in the table to restrict access to only resources that match the specified ARNs\. For the list of ARN formats, see [ARN Formats Supported by AWS Organizations](orgs_reference_arn-formats.md)\.

If you see an expand arrow \(**â†—** \) in the upper\-right corner of the table, you can open the table in a new window\. To close the window, choose the close button \(**X**\) in the lower\-right corner\.
